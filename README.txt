Building the Responsive multipage for Fat Cat Gym It was a hard to make the lading page responsive because I did it with pure CSS and JS, but I got a good idea about CSS while building this. Before, when my lecturer taught me, I thought CSS was way easier. However, when I tried to build and position the elements, I learned how hard it is to put one element into the right position.

 Files Involved
 
1.	index.html - this is The landing page file containing the structure of the of the lading page.
2.	Service.html- This page contain the programs that the gym providing 
3.	Contact.html – This page contain the contacting form
4.	About.html – This page contain the details of the gym
5.	Style.css – Styling of the landing page
6.	Style2.css – styling of the service, contact and about page 
7.	App.js – handling the handling some interactive elements on the pages.

For service.html, contact.html and about.html I used other style file because I style them with bootstrap it was easier because I done some other projects with it.in the contact page it doesn’t save the submitted values because I dint make a database for that other than that everything works fine. When I deal with some of the element when they come to right position I didn’t experiment them so some unnecessary styling like (justify-content) added to them.

Functional details

Navigation bar – when like on a link it goes to the correct place (ex- when services clicked it navigate to service.html page)when mouse hover on a link it’s color changes and grow a line under it when navigation bar goes under 800px width it show in the right side  not the top of the page.
the image on the hero section of lading page changes when mouse over and when mouse out it come to original position this is done by “ DOM manipulation”.  
Some of the paragraph or headings are change colors when hover.
When mouse hover Headings of the staff sections changed it color to electrical blue.
All of the icons are got form bootstrap icon CDN.

Buttons color changes when hover too.
Other than above details everything’s are responsive.
